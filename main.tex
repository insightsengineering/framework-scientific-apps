\section*{Introduction}
This template should be used as a starting point for AMIA submissions.  
It is important to review the AMIA Call for Participation (CFP) where types of submissions considered and general requirements for each submission type are listed. All submissions must conform to the format and presentation requirements described in the CFP and at the submission site.


\section*{Another Major Heading and References}
This sentence has two reference citations\cite{ref1,ref2}.

More text of an additional paragraph, with a figure reference (Figure ~\ref{fig1}) and a figure inside a Word text box below.  Figures need to be placed as close to the corresponding text as possible and not extend beyond one page.\\

*: All podium abstract and poster submissions must have a brief (50-75 words) abstract. The abstract does NOT have to be part of the document, but must be entered on the submission website in the Abstract box in Step 2.

**: \textcolor{red}{If your submission is longer than what is specified below, it will be rejected without review.}

\section*{Conclusion}
Your conclusion goes at the end, followed by References, which must follow the Vancouver Style (see: www.icmje.org/index.html).  References begin below with a header that is centered.  Only the first word of an article title is capitalized in the References.

\noindent{\bf Abstract (50-75 words, do not include in 1-page submission)}

\textit{Through a worked case study of an R package and Shiny dashboard for self-service health authority submission quality duration estimates, we lay a framework for robust efficiency. We make recommendations on 1) transparent and robust cohort definitions, 2) defensive restriction of user inputs to maintain results integrity, 3) the importance of separating scientific logic into a documented and tested independent package, 4) and a strategy for clear communication of validation scope and assumptions.}

After the poster session, the learner should be better able to:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Understand the importance of isolating, testing and documenting scientific logic as independent of graphical user interface code
  \item Have an understanding of unit testing, 
\end{itemize}
